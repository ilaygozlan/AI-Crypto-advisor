# Render Deployment Fix

## Problem
The bcrypt module was compiled for Windows and couldn't run on Render's Linux environment, causing the "invalid ELF header" error.

## Solution Applied
1. **Replaced `bcrypt` with `bcryptjs`**: A pure JavaScript implementation that doesn't require native compilation
2. **Updated import statement** in `server/services/user.service.js`
3. **Added build scripts** to `package.json` for proper deployment

## Changes Made
- `server/package.json`: Changed dependency from `bcrypt` to `bcryptjs`
- `server/services/user.service.js`: Updated import statement
- Added build and postinstall scripts

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix bcrypt deployment issue for Render"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **On Render**:
   - The deployment should now work automatically
   - If you need to manually redeploy, trigger a new deployment from your Render dashboard

3. **Local Testing** (optional):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)

If you prefer to keep using `bcrypt`, you can:

1. **Use bcrypt with proper build configuration**:
   - Add `"engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" }` to package.json
   - Ensure Render uses the same Node.js version

2. **Use bcrypt with prebuild**:
   - Add `bcrypt` back to dependencies
   - Add `"postinstall": "npm rebuild bcrypt"` to scripts

The `bcryptjs` solution is recommended as it's more reliable across different environments.
